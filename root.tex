\begin{abstract}
  Team 1280 designed an innovative robot for the 2024 FRC Crescendo
  competition through an interdisciplinary and iterative process. Key
  features include a precision ring intake, high-speed launcher, agile
  swerve drivebase, and advanced autonomous capabilities. This writeup
  details the team's engineering approach, from initial brainstorming to
  final validation, that resulted in a high-performing robot excelling
  in the competition environment.

\section{Introduction}

Our 2024 robot incorporates numerous new technologies we've been
exploring this year. Breaking a longstanding tradition of using a
rudimentary tank drive system, we used a 4-wheel swerve drivebase that
enables much more nimble and precise robot movements. We also were able
to implement computer vision, upgrading from a Microsoft webcam to two
limelights with a Google Coral TPU to identify game pieces, april tags,
and other visual fiducials. To create all of these features, we
underwent a massive overhaul of our prototyping and build process. In
this writeup, we'll discuss all of the work we accomplished this season
and our process.
